## Overview
Tomato plants are prone to various diseases that can significantly affect crop quality and yield. This project leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect diseases from images of tomato leaves. By using a well-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), the model can classify images into various disease categories, allowing for timely and accurate treatment recommendations.

## Features
- **Image-based Disease Detection**: Uses deep learning to classify tomato leaf images into different disease categories.
- **Real-time Inference**: Provides predictions quickly, making it suitable for field usage.
- **Scalable and Customizable**: Allows for additional disease classes and new plant types in future versions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Framework for building and training deep learning models.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and augmentation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for interactive model development and experimentation.
- **Numpy and Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of tomato leaves affected by various diseases as well as healthy leaves. The images are preprocessed and augmented to improve the model's performance and generalization.

Dataset source: [Kaggle: Tomato Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset) 

**Classes:**
1. Healthy
2. Early Blight
3. Late Blight

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nerdylua/Tomato-Disease-Prediction.git
   cd Tomato-Disease-Prediction
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Pre-trained Model Inference:
   - Run the following command to load a saved model and make predictions:
     ```bash
     python predict.py --image_path "path_to_image.jpg"
   - Replace `"path_to_image.jpg"` with the path to the leaf image you want to classify.
1. Training a New Model:
   - If you want to train the model from scratch with your dataset, refer to the [Model Training section](#model-training).

## Model Training
To train the model, follow these steps:
1. Organize your dataset in the following structure:
  ```bash
data/
├── train/
│   ├── Early_Blight/
│   ├── Late_Blight/
│   ├── Healthy/
│   └── ...
└── test/
    ├── Early_Blight/
    ├── Late_Blight/
    ├── Healthy/
    └── ...
```
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
- Adjust the `--epochs` and `--batch_size` parameters as per your system capabilities and requirements.
3. The model and training logs will be saved in the `models/` directory.
## Model Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model's performance on the test dataset:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path models/trained_model.h5
```
This script will display metrics such as accuracy and precision.

## Android Application
In addition to the Python-based disease prediction model, this project also includes an Android app for real-time disease detection using the trained model. The Android app is developed in Kotlin and can be used to upload images of plant leaves for classification.

### Features
- **Real-time Disease Detection**: Upload images directly from your mobile device and get predictions.
- **Cross-plant Support**: The model supports diseases for a variety of plants, not just tomatoes.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy plant disease identification.

### Additional Configuration (Optional)
If you want to modify the model or expand it to include more plant types or diseases:

1. Update the Model: The Android app uses a TensorFlow Lite model. You can replace the existing model with a custom-trained .tflite model by placing it in the assets/ directory and updating the relevant code to load the new model.
1. Modify the Plant Types: To support other plant types, update the model, dataset, and Android code accordingly to handle the new classifications.

## Future Work
- **Additional Classes**: Expand the model to include more diseases and support other plant types.
- **Mobile Integration**: Develop a mobile app to allow users to upload leaf images directly from the field for immediate diagnosis.
- **Improved Augmentation**: Experiment with advanced augmentation techniques to further improve model generalization.
